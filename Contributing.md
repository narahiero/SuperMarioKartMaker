## C++ Coding Style

Please refer to [CT Lib](https://github.com/NaraHiero/CTLib)'s C++ coding style guidelines, which
can be found [here](https://github.com/narahiero/CTLib/blob/master/Contributing.md#cpp-code-style).

The only differences are listed below:
- Prefix all member variables with `m_`
- Prefix all static variables with `s_`
- Prefix all global variables with `g_`
